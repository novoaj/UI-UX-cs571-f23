# Badger Chat (React)

In this project, I implemented React Router for multi-page navigation, utilized React-Bootstrap components for responsive design, managed user authentication state using context and sessionStorage, and interacted with an API to fetch and post chat messages. I also implemented features such as user registration, login, logout, posting messages, and deleting messages while ensuring validation and error handling.
