# Badger Bakery (React Native)

Learned to prototype and implement a mobile app using React Native. Created a lofi Figma prototype for mobile devices, focusing on key features like viewing baked goods, adding them to the basket, and checking out. In the implementation, I fetched and displayed baked goods, allowed navigation between items, managed the basket, calculated the order total, and enabled order submission with appropriate feedback.
