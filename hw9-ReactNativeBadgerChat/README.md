# Badger Chat (React Native)

Re-implemented BadgerChat as a mobile application. Learned to manage user authentication, display chatrooms and messages dynamically, implement pagination for messages, create and delete posts, handle logout, and allow anonymous access. Technologies used include React Navigation, expo-secure-store for JWT storage, and React Native components for UI development.
