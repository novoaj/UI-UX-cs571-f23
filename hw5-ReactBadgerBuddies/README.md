# Badger Buddies (REACT)

In this project, I leanred to implement multi-page navigation using React Router, manage state with session/local storage, and utilize React-Bootstrap components for responsive design. I fetched and displayed cat adoption data, allowing users to save, unsave, and adopt cats while ensuring UI responsiveness and accessibility.
